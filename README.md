## Python Solutions to Leetcode

This project started off as a pure fun assignment to keep up with the latest trends in algorithm and data structure problems(doubles up as a quick digest when I've to interview someone... or take an interview) as they make it to leetcode. Feel free to use, abuse - here's a few tips that might facilitate understanding -
 * The solutions are written in Python 3 and the problems appear in no particular sequence. 
 * The problems are hosted in individual python files by the problem number followed by the problem name separated by underscores. The problem statement and example input output is quoted above each problem in docstrings.
 * Most problems have a calling client to test the code locally.
 * I've provided a few of the useful data structures that one might need to test the code. They are in the package data_types inside the leetcode package. 
 * There are some problems in the outliers package inside of leetcode which are cool but haven't made it to www.leetcode.com yet. Feel free to check them out.
 * Lastly, the problems are not updated in the repo in their natural sequence, I pick and choose the ones that I find interesting, although eventually plan to solve them all.
