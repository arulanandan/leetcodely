## Python Solutions to Leetcode

This project started off as a pure fun assignment to keep up with the latest trends in algorithmic and data structures questions(also serves as a quick digest when I've to interview someone.. or take an interview) as they make it to leetcode. Feel free to use, abuse - here's a few tips that might facilitate understanding -
 * The solutions are written in Python 3 and the problems appear in no particular sequence. 
 * The problems though are hosted in individual python files by the problem number. The problem statement is quoted above each problem in docstrings.
 * Most problems have a calling client to test the code locally.
 * I've provided a few of the useful data structures that one might need to test the code. They are in the package types inside of src. 
 * Lastly, the problems are not updated in the repo in their natural sequence, I pick and choose the ones that I find interesting, although eventually I plan to solve them all.
